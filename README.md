# Cut to the Heart of the Matter:  Leading Causes of Death

**What is your health risk for 5 of the leading causes of death?**
Our project will focus on predicting how an individual’s demographic information will have an impact on their risk for 5 of the leading causes of death.  

The causes of death that we will investigate will be:  
- Cerebrovascular diseases
- Chronic lower respiratory diseases
- Accidents (unintentional injuries)
- Alzheimer disease
- Diabetes mellitus
 
**What we will ask:**
Based on your demographic data:
- What leading cause of death is your biggest health risk today? 
- What leading cause of death is your biggest risk of health 10 years from now?
- What is your risk for each leading cause of death? 
 
**How we will answer:**
- We will build an app (web page) where a user can select their demographic data from a dropdown and receive an output with answers to these questions.  
- The answer that the user receives will be a prediction output from a Machine Learning algorithm that has been trained on data from the CDC’s mortality database.  
- The ML model will be trained on key demographic features such as age, gender, marital status, education, race, and Hispanic descent.
